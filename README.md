# ARK Smart Breeding

For the game ARK Survival Evolved. Extracts possible levelups of creatures to get the values for breeding. Save your creatures in a library, sort and compare their stats, view their pedigree, use the breeding-plan to get the best possible creatures and keep track of the growing babies with timers.

## Manual
See the wiki on more info, e.g. [Manual](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor/wiki/Manual) with links to external resources like **guides and videos**, or [Extraction issues](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor/wiki/Extraction-issues) if something does not work.

## Download
Download the [latest release here](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor/releases/latest).

* The file values.json contains all the stats, default-multipliers and other values (taming, breeding), it can be edited and updated if necessary.
* The image-files for the colored-creature-views have to be downloaded separately: [Creature-Images](https://github.com/cadon/ARKStatsExtractor/raw/master/images.zip). Extract the folder "img" in the application's folder to get better visuals of the creature's colors. Currently 7 creatures are included. You don't need to redownload this file if you already have the creature-images.
